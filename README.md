# Sepsis-Classification-ML-Project-with-FAST-API-Integration
This repository houses a machine learning project focused on the early detection and classification of sepsis, and integrating the model into a web application using FAST API.

# Description:
This repository houses a machine learning project focused on the early detection and classification of sepsis, a life-threatening medical condition. Sepsis is a critical concern in healthcare, and early diagnosis can significantly improve patient outcomes. In this project, we have developed a robust machine learning model for sepsis classification and integrated it into a web application using FAST API, making it accessible for real-time predictions.

# Project Overview:
**i. Data Collection and Preprocessing:** We collected and preprocessed a comprehensive dataset containing clinical and physiological data from patients to train and evaluate our sepsis classification model.

**ii. Machine Learning Model:** We implemented a state-of-the-art machine learning model tailored for sepsis classification. This model has been fine-tuned to achieve high accuracy in detecting sepsis early, which is crucial for timely intervention.

**iii. FAST API Integration:** We've seamlessly integrated the trained machine learning model into a web application using FAST API. This web application allows healthcare professionals to input patient data and receive instant predictions regarding sepsis risk.

**iv. Usage and Deployment:** In the README file, you will find detailed instructions on how to use and deploy this web application, making it user-friendly for both developers and healthcare practitioners.
